This repository contains script associated with the manuscript "Chemical and Non-Chemical Stressors in a Postpartum Cohort through Wristband and Self Report Data: Links between Increased Chemical Burden, Economic, and Racial Stress" (Hickman E, Frey J, Wylie A, Hartwell HJ, Herkert N, Roell K, Fry RC, Short S, Stapleton H, Propper C, Rager J). This manuscript is under revision with Environment International.

This script was developed to identify patterns of chemical and social stress co-occurence as measured through wristbands and self report data. Script is divided into subfolders for data processing, chemical pattern analysis, relationships between chemical, demographic, and social stressor data, and hair cortisol analysis (subset of participants).
